```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
int sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
print(sum);

//This code snippet will work correctly most of the time. However, if the list 'numbers' is empty, an error will occur. This is because the 'reduce' method requires at least one element in the list.
